# llm-rules

## WIP!!!

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/llm-rules.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/llm-rules)

A collection of LLM rules and instructions for AI coding assistants to help with code generation, best practices, and project-specific guidelines. Also provides functionality to dynamically load rules files from within repositories.

## Overview

This package provides structured rules and instructions that can be used by AI coding assistants like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and other LLM-powered development tools to better understand project conventions, coding standards, and specific requirements. It can also dynamically load and parse rules files from within repositories, such as `.cursor/rules` files and other AI assistant configuration files.

## Usage

To use these rules in your project:

```bash
npm install llm-rules
```

The rules can be integrated into your development workflow to provide consistent AI assistance across your codebase. The package can also dynamically discover and load rules files from your repository structure.

## Features

- Project-specific coding guidelines
- Best practice recommendations
- Structured instructions for AI assistants
- Dynamic loading of rules files from repositories (e.g., Cursor rules, AI assistant configs)
- Extensible rule system

For more information on implementing LLM rules in your development workflow, see the documentation.
